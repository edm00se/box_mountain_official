Each bag has a label on it with manufacturer's advised print settings and additional information to get you started right out of the box. In addition to the samples, we reach out to manufacturers of 3D printing accessories and other related products to get exclusive discounts for our Maker Box subscribers.

This is equivalent to about 50 grams of PLA, but will be lower weight for low density materials and higher weight for higher density materials like BronzeFill. We chose do to length instead of weight because some materials, such as metal filled ones, are a lot denser than your typical PLA. This would mean you would receive significantly less printing volume with the same weight of material."
